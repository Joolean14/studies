Elephant and blind city
Looking inside the system, drug addiction, war.
You've been thinking like this before you even picked up this book.

elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose.

For example, the elements of your digestive system include teeth,
enzymes, stomach, and intestines. They are interrelated through the physi-
cal fl ow of food, and through an elegant set of regulating chemical signals.
The function of this system is to break down food into its basic nutrients
and to transfer those nutrients into the bloodstream (another system),
while discarding unusable wastes.

Is there anything that is not a system? Yes—a conglomeration without
any particular interconnections or function. Sand scattered on a road by
happenstance is not, itself, a system. You can add sand or take away sand
and you still have just sand on the road. Arbitrarily add or take away foot-
ball players, or pieces of your digestive system, and you quickly no longer
have the same system.

When a living creature dies, it loses its “system-ness.” The multiple
interrelations that held it together no longer function, and it dissipates,
although its material remains part of a larger food-web system.

How to know whether you are looking at a system or just a bunch
of stuff :
A) Can you identify parts? . . . and
B) Do the parts aff ect each other? . . . and
C) Do the parts together produce an eff ect that is diff er-
ent from the eff ect of each part on its own? . . . and
perhaps
D) Does the eff ect, the behavior over time, persist in a
variety of circumstances?

If information-based relationships are hard to see, functions or purposes
are even harder. A system’s function or purpose is not necessarily spoken,
written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system.
The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see
how the system behaves.

If a frog turns right and catches a fl y, and then turns left and catches a
fl y, and then turns around backward and catches a fl y, the purpose of the
frog has to do not with turning left or right or backward but with catching
fl ies. If a government proclaims its interest in protecting the environment
but allocates little money or effort toward that goal, environmental protec-
tion is not, in fact, the government’s purpose. Purposes are deduced from
behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.

System purposes need not be human purposes and are not necessar-
ily those intended by any single actor within the system. In fact, one of
the most frustrating aspects of systems is that the purposes of subunits
may add up to an overall behavior that no one wants. No one intends to
produce a society with rampant drug addiction and crime, but consider
the combined purposes and consequent actions of the actors involved:
• desperate people who want quick relief from psychological
pain
• farmers, dealers, and bankers who want to earn money
• pushers who are less bound by civil law than are the police
who oppose them
• governments that make harmful substances illegal and use
police power to interdict them
• wealthy people living in close proximity to poor people
• nonaddicts who are more interested in protecting themselves
than in encouraging recovery of addicts

Changing elements usually has the least effect on the system. If you change
all the players on a football team, it is still recognizably a football team. (It
may play much better or much worse—particular elements in a system
can indeed be important.)

If the interconnections change, the system may be greatly altered. It may
even become unrecognizable, even though the same players are on the team.
Change the rules from those of football to those of basketball, and you’ve got,
as they say, a whole new ball game.

Changes in function or purpose also can be drastic. What if you keep
the players and the rules but change the purpose—from winning to losing,
for example?

A stock, then, is the present memory of the history
of changing fl ows within the system.

You can adjust the drain or faucet of a bathtub—the fl ows—abruptly,
but it is much more diffi cult to change the level of water—the stock—
quickly. Water can’t run out the drain instantly, even if you open the drain
all the way. The tub can’t fi ll up immediately, even with the infl ow faucet on
full blast. A stock takes time to change, because fl ows take time to fl ow.

Stocks
usually change slowly. They can act as delays, lags, buffers, ballast, and
sources of momentum in a system.
