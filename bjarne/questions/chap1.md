1. What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program?

    The purpose of the 'Hello World' program is to test your programming environment.

2. Name the four parts of a function.

The 4 parts of a function are :
    1. Return data type.
    2. Name of the function
    3. Input parameters 
    4. Body

3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.

    The function 'main' must appear in every C++ program.

4. In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?

    The line that returns 0 signals that the function executed properly. If it signaled a 1 it would mean that there was an errror.

5. What is the purpose of the compiler?

    The purpose of the compiler is to convert source code to machine code. Checking syntax and semantics before parsing.

6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?

    The #include directive serves the purpose of importing modules of the C++ language that are not included by default.

7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?

    The .h suffix signifies that a file is a header file. 


<!-- No comprendo la diferencia entre object code y machine code, diagrama pagina 71 me confunde. Luego investigo en la web y al parecer es lo mismo. -->

8. What does the linker do for your program?

    A linker combines source code with object code to generate executable machine code.

9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?

    The difference between a source file and an object file is that source files contain the code written by programmers, on the other hand object files contain object code or machine code, that is code generated from source code by the compiler.

10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?

    IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It color codes language syntax, it has a built in console, downloadable plug-ins that extend standard functionality, file manager, search tools,  in other words, it  provides many features that make programming easier and more effective for me in a box. 

11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?

    It is necessary to practice because not applying the knowledge gathered in this textbook into practical examples would make using the concepts explained in a practical context impossible, thus making only understanding a waste of my time.
