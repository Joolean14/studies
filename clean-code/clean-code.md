# Foreword

"Honesty in small things is not a small thing"

This is a book about humble concerns whose value is nonetheless far from small.

The smallest bit of sloppy construction, of the door that does not close tightly or the slightly crooked tile on the floor, or even a messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole. That is what clean code is about.

In software, 80% or more  of what we do is quaintly called 'maintenence': the act of repair.

**seire** - Knowing where things are.

**seiton** - Tidiness. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it.

**seiso** - Cleaning(shine). Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps and waste.

**seiketsu** - Standarization.

**shutsuke** - Discipline.

In code, refactor mercilessly. 

Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.

Preoccupation with detail is common to all endeavors of excellence.

Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care- not just of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are simpledoesnÂ´t mean that they are simplistic, and it hardly means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty, in any human endeavor.

Did we do our best to leave the campground cleaner than we found it?

Did we refactor our code before checking in?
