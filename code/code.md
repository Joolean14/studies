**Morse code**

In Morse code you have two kinds of blinks-short blinks and long blinks.

"Dots" and "Dashes" is a convenient way of showing the codes in a printed page.

Every letter of the alphabet corresponds to a sort series of dots and dashes.

Although Morse code has absolutely nothing to do with computers, becoming familiar with the nature of codes is an essential preliminary to achieving a deep understanding of the hidden languages and inner structures of computer hardware and software.

By convention, the length of a dash should be about three times that of a dot.

Pauses between the dots and dashes of Morse code are crucial. When you send an 'A', for example, the flashlight should be off between the dot and the dash for a period of time equal to about one dot. If the dot is one second long, the gap between dots and dashes is also a second. Letters in the same word are separated by longer pauses equal to about the lenght of one dash.

Words are separated by an off period of about two dashes.

The length of time that the flashlight remains on and off aren't fixed. They're all relative to the length of a dot.

At first, the definition of Morse code- and by definition I mean the correspondence of various sequences of dots and dashes to the letters of the alphabet-appears as random as the layout of a typewriter. On closer inspection, however, this is not entirely so. The simpler and and shorter codes are assigned to the more frequently used letters of the alphabet, such as E and T. Scrabble players and Wheel of Fortune fans might notice this right away. The less common letters, such as Q and Z, have longer codes.

Three dots, three dashes and three dots represent SOS, the international distress signal. SOS isn't and abbreviation for anything-it's simply an easy-to-remember Morse code sequence.

During the II World War, the BBC prefaced some radio broadcasts with the beginning of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony- which Ludwig didn't know at the time he composed the music is the Morse code V, for Victory.

One drawback of Morse code is that it makes no differentiation between uppercase and lowercase letters. It does include codes for numbers.

Most punctuation marks use five, six, or seven dots and dashes.

Additional codes are defined for accented letters of some European languages and as shorthand sequences for special purposes.

With some practice, you might be able to achieve a dending and receiving speed of 5 or ten words per minute- still much slower than speech(which is somewhere in the 100 words per minute range), but surely adequate.

In the same way that Morse code reduces written language to dots and dashes, the spoken word version(dit, dah) of the code reduces speech to just two vowel sounds.

The key word here is *two*. Two types of blinks, two vowel sounds, two different anything, really, can with suitanle combinations convey all types of information


In this book, the word *code* usually means a system for transferring information among people and machines. In other words, a code lets you comminicate. Sometimes we think of codes as a secret. But most codes are not. Indeed, most codes must be well understood because they're the basis of human communication.

We use a variety of different codes for communicating among ourselves because some codes are more convenient than others. For example, the code of the spoken word can't be stored on paper, so the code of the written word is used instead.

Various types of codes are also used in computers to store and communicate numbers, sounds, music pictures and movies. Computers can't deal with human codes directly because computers can't duplicate the ways in which human beings use their eyes, ears, mouths and fingers.


# 2. Codes and Combinations

The invention of Morse code goes hand in hand with the invention  of the telegraph.

Just as Morse code provides a good introduction to the nature of codes, the telegraph provides a good introduction to the hardware of the computer.

Most people find Morse code easier to send than to receive. Receiving Morse code and translating it back into words is considerably harder and more time consuming than sending because you must work backward to figure out the letter that corresponds to a particular coded sequence of dots and dashes.

The word *undefined* used in this context refers to a code that doesn't stand for anything. You could be pretty sure that somebody made a mistake.

Morse code is said to be *binary* code because the components of the code consist only of two things- a dot and a dash. That's similar to a coin, which can land only on the head side or the tail side. Binary objects are always described by powers of two.

What we're doing by analysing binary codes is a simple exercise in the branch of mathematics known as *combinatronics or combinatorial analysis*.
