# Directories

**/** Root
**/bin** Contains binaries that must be present for the system to boot and run
**/boot** Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image, boot loader
**/boot/grub/grub.conf or menu.lst** Used to configure boot loader
**/boot/vmlinuz** Linux kernel
**/dev** Device nodes
**/etc** System-wide configuration files, shell scripts that start each of the system services at boot time
**/etc/crontab** Defines when automated jobs will run
**/etc/passwd** List of user accounts
**/home** Each user is given a directory in /home. Ordinary users can only write files in their home directories. This limitation protects the system from errant user activity.
**/lib** Contains shared library files used by the core system programs.
**/lost+found** Each formatted partition or device using a linux file system will have this directory. It is used in case of a partial recovery from a file system corruption event. Unless something really bad happens to your system, this directory will remain empty.
**media** Mount points for removable media such as USB drives, CD-ROMS, etc that are mounted automatically at insertion.
**/mnt** On older Linux systems this directory contains points for removable devices that have been mounted manually.
**/opt** This directory is used to install 'optional' software. Commercial software products that might be installed on the system.
**/proc** Virtual file system mantained by the Linux kernel. 'Peepholes into the kernel'.
**/root** Home directory for the root account.
**/sbin** System binaries. Vital system tasks reserved for the superuser.
**/tmp** Storage of temporary transient files created by various programs. Some configurations cause this directory to be emptied each time the system is rebooted.
**/usr** Contains all programs and support files used by regular users.
**/usr/bin** Executable programs installed by the Linux distro.
**/usr/lib** Shared libraries for the programs in /usr/bin.
**/usr/local** Directory where programs that are not included in the distro but are intended for system-wide use are installed.
**/usr/sbin** Contains more system administration programs.
**/usr/share** Contains all the shared data used by programs in /usr/bin.
**/usr/share/doc** Installed packages docs.
**/var** Data that is likely to change is stored. Various databases, spool files, user mail...
**/var/log** Records of various system activity.

# Manipulating Files and Directories

**-r --recursive** -  Recursively copy directories and their contents. Required for copying directories.
**-u --update** - Only copy files that either don't exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files.
**-v --verbose** Display informative messages as the copy is performed.

# Working with commands

A command can be one of four different things:

1. An executable program
2. A command built into the shell itself
3. A shell function
4. An alias

**type** - indicate how a command name is interpreted

**which** - sometimes there is more than one version of an executable program installed on a system. While it is not common on desktop systems, it's not unusual on large servers.
To determine the exact location of a given executable, the *which* command is used.

# Getting a command's documentation

**help** - Get help for Shell builtins.

**man** - Display a programÅ› manual page

1. User commands
2. Programming interfaces for kernel system calls
3. Programming interfaces to the C library
4. Special files such as device nodes and drivers
5. File formats
6. Games and amusements such as screen savers
7. Miscellaneus
8. System administration commands

*man section searc_term* -> man 5 passwd

**apropos** - Display appropiate commands. It is also possible to search the list of man pages for possible matches based on a search term.

**whatis** - Display a one-line manual page description

**info** - Display a program's Info entry. Info manuals are displayed with a reader program named info. Info pages are *hyperlinked* much like webpages.

**alias** - Create an alias for a command.

1. Search with **type** if it already exists.
2. Create it like this:

    alias <name> = '<command>; <command>; ... '

3. To remove alias:

    unalias <command>

# Redirection

**cat** - Concatenate files
**sort** - Sort lines of text
**uniq** - Report or omit repeated lines
**grep** - Print lines matching a pattern
**wc** - Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
**head** - Output the first part of a vile
**tail** - Output the last part of a file
**tee** - read from standard input and write to standard output and files
